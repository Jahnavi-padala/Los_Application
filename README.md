# 📄 Loan Origination System (LOS)

## 📌 Overview

This **Loan Origination System (LOS)** is a robust, modular application built using **Spring Boot (multi-module)** architecture. It streamlines the loan application process by integrating with external services to fetch and verify critical KYC and credit information.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- ✅ **Multi-Module Architecture:** Clean separation of concerns with dedicated modules for core business logic, external integrations, and data management.
- ✅ **External Services Integration:**
  - **PAN Details Service** — Fetches and verifies PAN information.
  - **Aadhaar Details Service** — Retrieves customer Aadhaar data for identity verification.
  - **CIBIL Management Service** — Obtains customer CIBIL score and credit history to evaluate loan eligibility.
- ✅ **Loan Eligibility Calculation:** Uses PAN, Aadhaar, and CIBIL data to determine how much loan can be granted to a customer.
- ✅ **Customer Data Verification:** Validates customer KYC details using trusted external APIs.
- ✅ **Extensible & Scalable:** Easily add more services or modules as needed.

## 🗂️ Modules

This project uses a **multi-module** structure:

- **`los-core`** — Core business logic for processing loan applications.
- **`los-api`** — REST API layer to handle client requests.
- **`los-external`** — Integrations with external services (PAN, Aadhaar, CIBIL).
- **`los-data`** — Data persistence layer using Spring Data JPA.
- **`los-gateway`** *(Optional)* — API Gateway for routing requests if using microservices.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Customer submits loan application.**
2. System fetches:
   - PAN details from **PAN Service**
   - Aadhaar details from **Aadhaar Service**
   - CIBIL score & credit details from **CIBIL Service**
3. System verifies KYC and creditworthiness.
4. Calculates eligible loan amount based on:
   - CIBIL score
   - Active loans
   - Income vs. EMI ratio (if implemented)
5. Returns eligibility result and stores the application.
